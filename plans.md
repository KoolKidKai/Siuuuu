## Plans/Ideas/Wires

### Owner Requirements
 - Club calendar with events and time info
 - Roster page detailing members, roles, info


### Ideas
- Goal is to have the user interact with the website frequently
- Beginner coders must be entertained and attracted to the website; needs to be nicely designed
- Coders will get tasks to complete
- As they complete tasks, they will move up to different levels of difficulty; almost like a ranking system
- Each level has harder and harder tasks to complete
- Option of adding a score for each user as they move up levels
 
### Plans
- Use different APIs to make levels of code
- Use a google search bar for prizes and different fun gifs
- Have a music theme playing in the background after completing each level
- Design a nice and appealing website for everyone to read easily
