## Plans/Ideas/Wires

### Owner Requirements
 - Allow easy access for each member (Organization: Example of this is a Club calendar with events and time information)
 - Roster page detailing members, roles, info (This makes it easy for students and others to contact the right people if needed assistance)
 - Make the website appealing to coders (Just asking for students to write code is boring, so how we can change that is to add funny images and vibrant colors)
 - Add prizes to be able to push each coder to the next level. This allows people in the club not to get bored of coding and most importantly have fun when doing so in a friendly competition style.


### Ideas
- Goal is to have the user interact with the website frequently
- Beginner coders must be entertained and attracted to the website; needs to be nicely designed
- Coders will get tasks to complete
- As they complete tasks, they will move up to different levels of difficulty; almost like a ranking system
- Each level has harder and harder tasks to complete
- Option of adding a score for each user as they move up levels
 
### Plans
- Use different APIs to make levels of code
- Use a google search bar for prizes and different fun gifs
- Have a music theme playing in the background after completing each level
- Design a nice and appealing website for everyone to read easily
