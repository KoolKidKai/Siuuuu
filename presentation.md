# Sponsor Presentation 3/28

## This Week's Accomplishments

- Included new contact info
- Improved user interface and organization of navbar/tabs

## Current Plans

- Reduce focus on Ronaldo
  - The current website is a bit childish. So we want to make the site a little more mature by reducing the focus on Ronaldo and highlighting the code and technicals more.
  - Will work on wireframes and plans to reflect this

- Continue work on calendar and roster pages

- Need more info on technical plans
  - UML diagrams, subsystems, etc.

- Hosting plan and PII concerns by end of week

## Result of Review

### HackClub Sponsor Review

Concerns:
- How to secure personal information for users without any online bias
- Similar to Mr. Mortensen, they want to balance a website that is enjoyable and mature
- Ensure ease of use through a user-friendly interface/UI
- Do not make website too repetetive, change some features up

Appreciation:
- Liked the beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels of the code


### Mortensen Team Score Friday (3/18/22): 1.95/2

Feedback: 
- Emphasis on coding, rather than focusing on Ronaldo
- The website should show more sophistication than just for kids because it is hackclub
- Focus on one specific target audience, such as freshmen (new coders in high school)
- Implement a Technical Plan such as a UML Diagram or flowchart

Week Improvements:
- Evidence of wireframe design change to cater to younger audience and display Hackclub sponsor
- The wireframe also implements coding features to match a more mature theme (decreasing use of Ronaldo)


- Evidence of Technical Plan (flowchart/UML Diagram) outlining our project development proecudure:
