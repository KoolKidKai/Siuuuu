- Improved user interface and organization of navbar/tabs

## Current Plans

- Reduce focus on Ronaldo
  - The current website is a bit childish. So we want to make the site a little more mature by reducing the focus on Ronaldo and highlighting the code and technicals more.
  - Will work on wireframes and plans to reflect this

- Continue work on calendar and roster pages

- Need more info on technical plans
  - UML diagrams, subsystems, etc.

- Hosting plan and PII concerns by end of week
