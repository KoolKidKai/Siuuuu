# Siuuuu
We love diversity and also girls in comp sci, but we don't have any girls unfortunately. But we do have diversity. Go NightHawks!

## Project Description
Our project is dedicated to the learning, improvement, and utmost enjoyment of coding! We aspire to help beginners improve their coding ability by implementing a series of levels that increase difficulty as they complete the tasks. By the end, they should see themselves as better programmers than before while also having enjoyed the journey. We are Team Siuuuu and are sponsored by Hackclub, a group of coders hoping to teach beginner coders.
